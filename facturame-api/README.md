## Coding Exercise

**Factura.me SA de CV**, your brand new employer, needs a demo for an expense reporting tool. Electronic receipt records and related information are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Management has decided that React (or Angular) must be used in the frontend and that the backend will be accessible via Ruby on Rails.

The fields in the report:
- [x] Issuer name
- [x] Date issued
- [x] Issuer RFC
- [x] CFDI xml
- [x] Total amount
- [x] Employee name (the one reporting the expenses)
- [x] The demo will print the report using generated test data, paginated as necessary, ordered by the date issued.
